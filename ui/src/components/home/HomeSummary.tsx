              Growing up, technology was always part of my life. From playing
              Nintendo as a young child to taking apart and reassembling my
              family's Gateway computer, my curiosity for how things worked was
              insatiable.

              I started my career in technical support and eventually became a
              supervisor at a dot-com startup. In this role I was immersed in
              web development and email hosting in the Real Estate industry.
              Now, I'm working on an enterprise software engineering team at a
              global Saas company. I work on numerous microservices and user
              interfaces in multiple languages.

              Over the years, I've become proficient in Python,
              Typescript/Javascript, and Java. I thrive on solving complex
              problems. I'm constantly learning and adapting to new
              technologies, and I'm excited about the possibility of
              transitioning to an Architect role in the future where I am able
              to leverage my skills in cloud systems and development.
